# BasicPasswordGenerator
A basic Password generator which can be used to makes passwords from random strings of numbers, letters and characters or from a word list.

I used this as a way to start learning GUIs in java - it is far from perfect but it works fine doing what it is meant to do sooo..... yeah =)
